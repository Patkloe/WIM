            <h5>The 1991 hit song "Walking in Memphis" originally by singer and SongWriter Marc<br>
                Cohn poetically recalls his first visit to <a href=" https://www.liveabout.com/elvis-presleys-memphis-addresses-2321489">Memphis</a>-the taproof for some of <br>
                his treasured, influential musicians like Al Green, Elvis Presley, and Isaac Hayes. <br>
                <br> The song embodies a lot of the spirit and character of the city. If you're passing <br>
                through or spending leisure time in town, lines from the song point out great things <br>
                about Memphis and some potential sightseeing spots.<br>
             </h5>
             <h3>
                 The Inspiration for the Song
             </h3>
             <h5>
                 The story goes thatCohn was having a dry spell coming up with his signature music <br>
                and lyrics. He was inspired by masterful singer and songwriter James Taylor who had <br>
                said that he broke his writer's block by going somewhere he'd never been and then got <br>
                inspiration from that experience. Memphis was just the place for Cohn. <br><br>
                 As you learn from the song, Cohn did touristy things like visited Graceland but also <br>
                 asked friends for more obscure, off-the-beaten-path suggestions, which resulted in a <br>
                 visit to Full Gospel Tabernacle Church and the Hollywood Cafe in Robinsonville, <br>
                  Mississippi.<br>

             <h3>
                 Reference to Elvis and Sightseeing Spots
             </h3>
              <h5>
              Cohn makes quite a few references in the lyrics about Elvis. Cohn says he regrets this <br>
              In hindsight because the song was not meant as an homage to Elvis. He wrote the song <br>
              as an embodiment of his experience in the city as a whole, Take a look at the Elvis <br>
              memtions and some locations you might want to check out during a visit to Memphis <br>
              <ul>
              <li>
              <b>Sun Studio:</b> In the first line of the song, Cohm mentions blue suede shoes, a <br>
              reference to the rockability song "Blue Suede Shoes" that was originally recorded by <br>
              Carl Perkins and made famous by <a href=" https://www.liveabout.com/elvis-presleys-memphis-addresses-2321489">Elvis Presley.</a>
              Elvis recorded "Blue Suede Shoes"<br>
             for Sun Records  in Memphis. <a href=" https://www.sunstudio.com/">Sun Studio.</a> on Union Avenue was declared a National <br>
             Historic Landmark in 2003 and is now open to tourists. <br>
              </li>
              <li>
              <b>Lansky Brothers</b>:You can purchase a pair of blue suede shoes from <a href="https://www.sunstudio.com/">Lansky <br>
               Brothers,</a> "The clothier to the king," in downtown Memphis. There are two locations. <br>
               One is on Beale Street and the other inside the Peabody Hottel, The Lansky family<br>
               was one of Elvis's first stylists: they were responsible for the glitzy looks he became known for.
              </li>
              <li>
               <b> Union Avenue :</b> The reference to the "Ghost of Elvis on Union Avenue" was timely <br>
               when Cohn wrote the song, When Cohn visited Memphis in 1986, Elvis had been dead nine years. A the time, there had been many conspiracy theories swirling about<br>
               Elvis, including that he or his ghost has been sighted around the world. Union <br>
               Avenue is a major thoroughfare for car traffic in Memphis that leads to <br>
               Graceland. There is a misconception that the street is named after the Union Army. <br>
               It was actuallynamed in reference to the unification of different areas of the city <br>
               early in Memphis' formation.
              </li>
              <b>Graceland :</b> Cohn mentions the "gates of Graceland" and Elvis,"tomb." Graceland <br>
              was the mansion that was Elvis Presley's home and today is <a href="https://www.graceland.com/">open for visitors.</a>from <br>
              around the world. It is also where <a href=" https://www.liveabout.com/where-is-elvis-presley-buried-2321464">Elvis is buried.</a> The gate
